				<h2 class="major">Problem</h2>
				<p>
                                   Hanson Canada is a private education group providing secondary, post-secondary, and language programs to both domestic and                                    international students. ... Hanson delivers Cambrian College programs exclusively to international students.
								   
				<p>
									Hanson Canada is looking for a event system which icludes calender system, booking and payment system to incorporate, event info etc.
				</p>
				<p>
								   
								   Registration system which alerts all the students to make registrations, upload documents such as work permits, pay for fees, monitor fees and give constant updates to the students.
				</p>
				<p>
								   
								   Our third main objective would be to create a section which includes career services and alumni services to crete an area for career services, with a job/volunteer board, portal for employees to submit vacancies, platforms for students to directly apply to advertised vacancies through the web using uploaded resumes and cover letters.
				<p>
				</p>
								   
								   Tools to allow students to upload video resumes, resume/cover letter checking function for grammer errors, career resources area, alumni section with alumni news and updates, platform/forum to link alumni mentors to current students and recent grades etc.

			<article id="Solution">
				<h2 class="major">Solution</h2>
				<p>
					I will be designing and developing a modern responsive website which consists of a trendy &
					exciting landing page and highly interactive About page, products page and registration section which
					would attaract the new applicaants, future prospects, alumni, current students and administration.</p>
				<p>
					This website mainly showcases the list of Hanson  which is my Educational Instituation.
					which includes features Event System, Regisration System and Alumini&Career Services.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been Learning designing and developing of website from 6 months and i am capable of implementing this
					solution using essentially today’s most popular technologies.
					I will be able to develop this website even by simple HTML5 , CSS3, JS stack or on purely JS using
					SPA (single page application) model if you want it that way considering the maintanence factor.
